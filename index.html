              <b><p>One of my favorite Italian desserts is classic <a href="https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/easy-10-minute-tiramisu/">tiramisu</a>. Rich and creamy in texture with hints of espresso, almond and chocolate. Whats not to like? As a professional chef, Ive made my share of classic Tiramisu recipes but I always thought it took a few more steps than it should. So, I decided to revamp a classic tiramisu recipe to include all the flavor but less of the fuss</p>
              <p>It will be our secret, nobody needs to know this easy 10 Minute Tiramisu took you less than half the time to prepare. The few steps Ive simplified mean I can really enjoy entertaining and not just end up stuck in the kitchen when I make this recipe as something special to enjoy with family and friends.An easy and super delicious recipe for Tiramisu. Don't be scared of the raw eggs,they won't make you sick! The marsala can be replaced with dark rum, or even be left out completely, it is still delicious without the alcohol.

               <li>In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar until pale, doubled in volume, and "ribbons" remain for a few seconds when spoon is lifted from the mixture, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
               <li>Whisk in marscarpone a little bit at a time.</li>
               <li>In another large bowl, beat egg whites and remaining 1/4 cup sugar until stiff, glossy peaks form.</li>
               <li>Fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture.</li>
               <li>Add 2 tablespoons Marsala to the coffee.</li>
               <li>Dip Savoiardi ladyfingers quickly into the coffee and arrange in a layer in the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Do not "soak" the lTop with another layer of dipped ladyfingers. Spread remaining mascarpone mixture evenly on top of ladyfingers.adyfingers in the coffee or your Tiramisu will turn out soggy.</li>
               <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture on top of the ladyfingers.</li>
               <li>Refrigerate at least 8 hours before serving. (Overnight works well too.) This allows the filling to set and the ladyfingers to soften and absorb the coffee.</li>
               <li>Sprinkle with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings immediately before serving.</li>

I call this my Matilda Cake because I swear its just as good as the cake that Bruce Bogtrotter ate in Matilda. Moist, chocolatey perfection. This is the chocolate cake youve been dreaming of!. I have been searching for a great chocolate cake recipe for years. For my 18th birthday, my mom made an amazing chocolate cake. It was perfect. It was everything that a chocolate cake should be. Unfortunately, the recipe didnt seem to survive past that day. Losing that recipe was a tragedy. It set the bar for chocolate cake in my eyes. It took me almost a decade to recreate that perfect chocolate cake. I tried at least a dozen recipes and none of them lived up to my expectations. Until now</p>
              <p>I have found it. My search has ended. I now have THE recipe. If you have ever seen the movie Matilda you will surely remember the scene where the boy is forced to eat the most delicious looking chocolate cake ever. I feel just like that boy when I eat this cake. It is my Matilda chocolate cake for sure.A classic chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream, The cake my kids want as their birthday cake

            <b>
           <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350F/gas 4. Grease 2 x 9 sandwich tins and line tshe bases.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, mix together the flour, 75g of the cocoa, the baking pow</li>
                 <li>Cut 125g of the butter into chunks and place into the bowl of a free standing mixer with a paddle attachment (alternatively, you can use an electric hand whisk and a large mixing bowl). Beat for a couple of minutes until creamy.</li>
                 <li>Add the sugar and beat for a few more minutes until pale. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add ½ a tablespoon of the vanilla; scraping the mixture off the sides and bottom.</li>
                 <li>Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, along with the freshly brewed coffee and milk, and mix slowly until it all comes together.</li>
                 <li>Beat vigorously for a further minute, then divide the batter between the two cake tins. Place them in the middle of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until cooked through. When they are ready, leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                 <li>Cut the remaining butter into chunks and place into the bowl of your free standing mixer with a paddle attachment (again, you can use an electric hand whisk and a large mixing bowl instead). Beat on a high speed for 2 minutes until creamy, then sift in the remaining 50g of cocoa and half the icing sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk and beat again for 1 minute.</li>
                 <li>Sift in the remaining icing sugar, and add the remaining milk and ½ a tablespoon of vanilla extract, then beat everything on a high speed for a couple of minutes until super smooth.</li>
                 <li>Use a little buttercream to stick one of the sponges onto your chosen cake stand or board. Spoon on a third of the buttercream and spread it out to the edges of the cake, then top with the second sponge.</li>
                 <li>Spoon on most of the remaining buttercream (reserving a few spoonfuls for piping on top) and gently spread it over the top of the cake and down the sides, until the entire cake is covered. Alternatively, you can use a little less buttercream and keep the edges open.</li>
                 <li>Decorate with the fresh berries and shavings of quality chocolate over the top, if you like.</li>
